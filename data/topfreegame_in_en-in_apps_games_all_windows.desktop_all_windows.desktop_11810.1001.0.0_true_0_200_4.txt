The game is fun to play and easy to learn.\r\nAll of us have played Tambola at social gatherings, office get-togethers, kitty parties and society events.\r\n\r\nTambola can be played in many different ways depending on the competency level.\r\nAmerican version of Tambola is called ‘Bingo’ and it is slightly different from Tambola.\r\n\r\nEach player must buy at least one ticket to enter a game. Tambola is played with Numbers (1-90) being called out one at a time and players striking out those Numbers on their Tickets. It contains 27 spaces, arranged in nine columns by three rows. Each row contains five numbers and four blank spaces. Each column contains up to three numbers, with some variation depending on Bingo or\r\n\r\nTambola companies and/or where the game is played.\r\n\r\nThe first column contains numbers from 1 to 9 (or 10), the second column numbers from 10 (or 11) to 20, the third, 20 (or 21) to 30 and so on up until the last column, which contains numbers from 81 to 90.\r\n\r\nThe game begins with a ball draw. As the game progresses, the board is marked with each ball that is drawn. The objective of the game is to mark/ dab all the numbers found in the ticket as called by the dealer. The player who first mark all the numbers in a winning pattern and calls a win is declared as the WINNER of that pattern after the dealer checks his ticket and verify it with numbers drawn.\r\n\r\nIf your claimed winning pattern is wrong, it will be called BOGUS and you cannot continue the game with the same ticket.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when all 90 numbers are drawn, or when a winner is declared for all the patterns of the game, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nIn order to win in Tambola or Bingo, you need to match winning combinations. Some of the popular winning combinations in a Tambola game are:\r\n\r\nEarly Five : The ticket with first five number dabbed\r\nTop Line: The ticket with all the numbers of the top row dabbed fastest.\r\nMiddle Line: The ticket with all the numbers of the middle row dabbed fastest.\r\nBottom Line: The ticket with the numbers of the bottom row dabbed fasted.\r\nFour Corners: The ticket with all four corners marked first i.e. 1st and last numbers of top and bottom rows.\r\nFull House: The ticket with all the 15 numbers marked first.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P1BJV28NMHT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Galaxy Shooter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47308.14510096240979360.39d4acfb-fd38-45f8-92e5-4e84d28a7450.83a9ce4f-ca4c-4767-96c2-5faaf7fc1ecd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34853.14510096240979360.d899258e-aac7-4fbc-9bec-0f663913e1c4.a4954feb-e753-46f8-b65d-5b25f2b23d24","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["21108PianoMusicStudio.GalaxyShooter_m18892jqh4q9e"],"ContentIds":["ca8805fa-e22d-de5f-d775-0c35dda839cf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you like space shooting and survival games and like to simulate sky shooting in for glory and duty, then Galaxy Space Invader is the one you should be shooter playing.\r\nTo accomplish this task, you must have the courage and wisdom.\r\nIn this bullet hell shooter game, you will be faced with an increasingly large number of projectiles and enemies.

That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLXMP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire Pack (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18834.9007199266438312.c9bdfc2d-7f13-40ca-9f66-b6672cb540af.e9a3de9f-194f-4bc2-a978-9bb96103a621","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51385.9007199266438312.be03de5f-a069-4a91-852a-0bcb7829c3f9.9b0ae5ec-a49d-41ab-adb8-76b45f9533bb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SolitairePackFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["976ca466-abff-e391-8051-f18b04a71411","14a6f70a-f32c-ba4b-9428-5dd35bef0a9e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Back in 1990s inclusion of Solitaire (Klondike) and Minesweeper in Windows has resulted in billions of hours of lost productivity over the years. Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMMMN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Motorbike Quiz - Street","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40351.9007199266449093.c3bbe96b-1177-454b-8216-1951a30ae48a.e0b3fde8-a3a0-4cfb-b67b-a28294bc3a4a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45651.9007199266449093.b306d7d1-24a5-41fc-aaf0-676fa19a81ad.45a7b665-e0db-40db-a5d6-6518aaa1fab8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.4,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["65327Damicolo.MotorbikeQuiz-Street_3fzfqdacad5k6"],"ContentIds":["fd97304d-1e43-81d3-fc07-0e3f440a60f1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Test your street motorcycle knowledge and recognizes all these fabulous bikes\r\nMore than 200 motorbikes to guess!\r\nThree different ways to play.\r\nSix different difficulty levels to unlock.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDN0P2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"GK Test","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64421.9007199266459423.e18db24c-175f-4968-a67f-af57dacc8806.02041de7-8643-4cd1-a5f3-d745f034f233","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#770D50","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["14955M.DaniyalNoor.GKTest_nd0j3zwdearp8"],"ContentIds":["5b9bd7c2-4d07-e0e0-ac48-5c6b0bcedecd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Its an awesome Quiz with different categories of Flags, Logos, Zodiac Signs etc.\r\nIn our daily life we see Logos of many Brands, Flags of many countries in different Sports and we know our Zodiac Signs of our Stars.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJ0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"GunFinger","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43551.9007199266251739.ff6002da-ee85-4189-b457-596dc9be2c5a.cc3d4893-c041-485c-8a03-21993bddadcc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50762.9007199266251739.52adefc0-c3a2-4644-af23-3769a78b03f0.c0486345-695f-43f5-b8ae-1037e8418f38","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60734.9007199266251739.140b4ded-1fb8-4f8b-820c-bfcfa05c9857.333aaa3d-8844-421e-b87e-2995f9130f8b","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23341.9007199266251739.fccd9845-16d2-4dcb-92c7-6fc5db22f718.b01a38d1-7e92-4992-b11e-1560cbc9e53c","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63594.9007199266251739.c4c4b34c-6dce-41e0-baf1-f6e98ee56d1d.e681a81e-4e7c-4b26-ba6b-ed96db3191b1","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33070.9007199266251739.91531e6d-6982-4cae-8af0-c0c456ed4c27.811d242f-46b7-4d88-8eb3-2dd16b4e61fb","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"174","PackageFamilyNames":["PixelToys.GunFinger_7092mkm8rcvy0"],"ContentIds":["6acd3c57-cfd6-1a72-c76f-008b90f8c6d6","c6df7e68-4a48-aeac-1ce1-1344579e86d9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get GUNFINGER now FREE and experience the most awesome shooting adventure on phone and tablet! \r\n\r\nSHOOTER GAMEPLAY REDESIGNED FOR TOUCH\r\nEasy to pick up, challenging to master, it’s up to you and your fast finger skills to mow down hordes of undead hillbillies using the GUNFINGER aim system. \r\n\r\nA NEW CHALLENGE FREE EVERY DAY\r\nThere’s always something new with Daily Challenge, enjoy playing a new mission every day! \r\n\r\nPOWERFUL UPGRADABLE WEAPONS \r\nCustomise an arsenal of unique weapons, including shotguns and sniper rifles, to take down undead monsters, rescue civilians and complete increasingly challenging skill missions.\r\n\r\nSTUNNING HIGH-END GRAPHICS\r\nFeaturing some of the most awesome 3D graphics you’ll see on a phone or tablet, GUNFINGER supports cutting edge effects like real-time reflections, shadows and normal maps.\r\n\r\nINSANE GADGETS\r\nUse your bag of special gadgets to ensure the undead stay dead, including ‘head-popper’ ammo to make their heads swell and explode!\r\n\r\nCRAZY COMBOS\r\nChain together combos to boost your score by performing trick shots and special kills. \r\n\r\nOVER 70 MISSIONS OF SHOOTING MAYHEM \r\nJoin the NE1 secret agency and embark on your adventure to defeat Doc Monday in more than 70 missions set across locations including spooky farmsteads, desert canyons and underground mines.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.
